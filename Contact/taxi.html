            <h2 class="subtitle">Shared Taxi (Servees)</h2>
            <p>As you walk around, you may hear drivers honking at you. Often, it's their 
                way of offering a ride. If you're ready to hop in, just wave them down and 
                ask, “Servees?” This shared taxi service allows drivers to pick up and drop
                 off passengers along their route.</p>

                 <p>offers two options: single and double. A single Servees typically 
                 covers short trips, like traveling from Gemmayzeh to Hamra (around 4 km). 
                 Previously, this fare was around 100,000 LBP per person, with longer trips 
                 costing a double fare of about 200,000 LBP. However, prices have risen 
                 recently, so it's best to confirm the rate before starting your ride, as 
                 Lebanese taxis do not use meters.</p> 

                 <p>While navigating the Servees system may take some getting used to, 
                    it quickly becomes one of the most affordable and practical ways to 
                    travel around.</p>
